# **Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

The artifact for the software design and engineering category is my final project from 
CS-310 that I completed in March 2025.  It is a calculator application that is used to 
help complete some basic math problems.  

This item was selected because it is a good example of testing data. When bulding the project, I added to multiplication, 
division and power classes. I was able to test each code with jUnit to make sure they werre working properly before submission. 
The artifact is improved by adding new the new classes to function easier. 
 
When enhancing this project I learned to stay within the bounds of the project and not to become too 
ambitions.  The areas of my project that I focused on seemed like they were common sense improvements
and extensions.  It also helped that I hadnâ€™t looked at my project for some months and could look at
it with fresh eyes. The only challenges that I faced were attempting to get tests to function properly
and test the correct data.
