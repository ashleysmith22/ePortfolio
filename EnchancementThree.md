# **Enhancement Three: Databases**

The artifact used for the databases category is a project from CS-310 that was completed 
in March of 2025.  It is a java file that was designed to collaborate with my classmates to each create their
own musical playlists. Each studet were given the instructions to add our own songs, login's and album choices.

This project was selected as my third artifact because it is an excellent example of how databases 
are constructed at the back end.  I picked this artifact because it was something I enjoyed adding to/making 
in my CS 310 class. The components for this artifact showcase team collaboration, it showcases the organization 
of the albums, playlists and musical artists just like playing music on Spotify or Pandora. The artifact 
has improved by adding my own choice in music and my own playlist. It helps store everyone's songs, 
playlists and artists throughout the project. 

When I was enhancing my project, I learned to add my own songs, albums and create different logins for each person's
own playlist. I tried this project 6 different times on 3 different computers. I struggled a lot beginning this 
project. I spent half a day trying to figure out where I was going wrong and finally, at 11 pm, I got my project 
to finally do what was needed. I was able to add my songs, collaborate with my team and add my own playlist. When 
I first added my own student profile to link to my own playlist, I was unable to link my login information to my 
playlist. I realized when I entered my profile information, it was linking to another student. I had set my profile 
number to the other students instead of creating a new profile login number. After I corrected this, my whole program 
ran correctly.
