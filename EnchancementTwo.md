# **Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

The artifact I am using for my enhancement two is the Jukebox application from my CS 310 class. It is a collaboration 
of musical artists, songs, playlists from myself and classmates. This was created originally by my professor in 
2020 I believe, but students have added to it each class he has taught.

I picked this artifact because it was something I enjoyed adding to/making in my CS 310 class. The components 
for this artifact showcase team collaboration, it showcases the organization of the albums, playlists and 
musical artists just like playing music on Spotify or Pandora. The artifact has improved by adding my own 
choice in music and my own playlist. It helps store everyone's songs, playlists and artists throughout the 
project. 

My goal was to be able to add my own playlist, songs and artists. I wanted to add my own songs and 
pick some of my favorite artists. I spent half a day working on this project and struggled a lot when I 
first began. After many hours, I was able to successfully add my own playlist.
  
I tried this project 6 different times on 3 different computers. I struggled a lot beginning this project. 
I spent half a day trying to figure out where I was going wrong and finally, at 11 pm, I got my project to 
finally do what was needed. I was able to add my songs, collaborate with my team and add my own playlist. When 
I first added my own student profile to link to my own playlist, I was unable to link my login information to 
my playlist. I realized when I entered my profile information, it was linking to another student. I had set my 
profile number to the other students instead of creating a new profile login number. After I corrected this, 
my whole program ran correctly.
