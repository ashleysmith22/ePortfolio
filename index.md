# **CS-499 ePortfolio**



## **Introduction**
Hello my name is Ashley Smith, and I started attending SNHU's 
computer science seven years ago. This gitHub pages account is meant 
to provide an electronic portfolio from which I finishmy final 
project for CS-499 and compelete my Bachelor's degree in computer science.  


## **Education Review**
Compeleting my coursework for this class has led me to appreciate the importance of reviewing 
and polishing one's work in a professional manner.  This review process can often include 
removing and rewriting unnecessarily complicated code, adding comments, and increasing a program's
capabilities. During the course of this class, I have enhanced my artifacts through the addition
of new classes for my calculator application and my jukebox application.
   
Working in a team environment has helped me appreciate the value of having a fresh perspective 
on my work. Sometimes, I become too immersed in a project and lose the ability to assess it 
objectively. Having another set of eyes review it often uncovers overlooked mistakes and 
offers valuable suggestions for improvement. 

## **Artifacts**
The artifacts presented for the portfolio are introductions to my work for software design and 
engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases.  Through the course of the class, I 
have improved my artifacts software, expanded their complexity, and added comments to make their code
easier to read.

# **Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering**

The artifact for the software design and engineering category is my final project from 
CS-310 that I completed in March 2025.  It is a calculator application that is used to 
help complete some basic math problems.  

This item was selected because it is a good example of testing data. When bulding the project, I added to multiplication, 
division and power classes. I was able to test each code with jUnit to make sure they werre working properly before submission. 
The artifact is improved by adding new the new classes to function easier. 
 
When enhancing this project I learned to stay within the bounds of the project and not to become too 
ambitions.  The areas of my project that I focused on seemed like they were common sense improvements
and extensions.  It also helped that I hadnâ€™t looked at my project for some months and could look at
it with fresh eyes. The only challenges that I faced were attempting to get tests to function properly
and test the correct data.

# **Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

The artifact I am using for my enhancement two is the Jukebox application from my CS 310 class. It is a collaboration 
of musical artists, songs, playlists from myself and classmates. This was created originally by my professor in 
2020 I believe, but students have added to it each class he has taught.

I picked this artifact because it was something I enjoyed adding to/making in my CS 310 class. The components 
for this artifact showcase team collaboration, it showcases the organization of the albums, playlists and 
musical artists just like playing music on Spotify or Pandora. The artifact has improved by adding my own 
choice in music and my own playlist. It helps store everyone's songs, playlists and artists throughout the 
project. 

My goal was to be able to add my own playlist, songs and artists. I wanted to add my own songs and 
pick some of my favorite artists. I spent half a day working on this project and struggled a lot when I 
first began. After many hours, I was able to successfully add my own playlist.
  
I tried this project 6 different times on 3 different computers. I struggled a lot beginning this project. 
I spent half a day trying to figure out where I was going wrong and finally, at 11 pm, I got my project to 
finally do what was needed. I was able to add my songs, collaborate with my team and add my own playlist. When 
I first added my own student profile to link to my own playlist, I was unable to link my login information to 
my playlist. I realized when I entered my profile information, it was linking to another student. I had set my 
profile number to the other students instead of creating a new profile login number. After I corrected this, 
my whole program ran correctly.

# **Enhancement Three: Databases**

The artifact used for the databases category is a project from CS-310 that was completed 
in March of 2025.  It is a java file that was designed to collaborate with my classmates to each create their
own musical playlists. Each studet were given the instructions to add our own songs, login's and album choices.

This project was selected as my third artifact because it is an excellent example of how databases 
are constructed at the back end.  I picked this artifact because it was something I enjoyed adding to/making 
in my CS 310 class. The components for this artifact showcase team collaboration, it showcases the organization 
of the albums, playlists and musical artists just like playing music on Spotify or Pandora. The artifact 
has improved by adding my own choice in music and my own playlist. It helps store everyone's songs, 
playlists and artists throughout the project. 

When I was enhancing my project, I learned to add my own songs, albums and create different logins for each person's
own playlist. I tried this project 6 different times on 3 different computers. I struggled a lot beginning this 
project. I spent half a day trying to figure out where I was going wrong and finally, at 11 pm, I got my project 
to finally do what was needed. I was able to add my songs, collaborate with my team and add my own playlist. When 
I first added my own student profile to link to my own playlist, I was unable to link my login information to my 
playlist. I realized when I entered my profile information, it was linking to another student. I had set my profile 
number to the other students instead of creating a new profile login number. After I corrected this, my whole program 
ran correctly.
